description: '"The after-life was a major component of ancient Egyptian culture, upon
  which much of their society was centered around. Death and resurrection was considered
  a constant cycle. This book is the first comprehensive study of ancient Egyptian
  ceremonies. The author, Budge, was the keeper of the Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities
  at the British Museum and devoted his life to understanding their mysteries. This
  book goes much further in explaining ancient Egyptian rituals, text and artifacts
  than many newer books have done"--back cover.'
